# D9-Mk2-Fixed-Sensor
Mk2 firmware for use with mk1 printer, Has the z offset adjust and filament unload reload features. Aswell as PID bed heat controll



Make sure to create a copy of your motor step values. this firmware will reset them.
also a pid tune will need to be completed before printing otherwise the bed will take too long to heat up.
to do that you will need to connect your printer via usb and send it commands via terminal.
i suggest using pronterface as cura's built in terminal seems to have trouble maintaining connection.
